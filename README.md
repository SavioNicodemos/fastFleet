### Navigation
All navigation in the app was made with [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) using Stack Navigator.

### Data Management
For offline data management, was used the **Realm** local database that stores all the trip data when there's no internet connection. As soon as the device connects to the internet, the stored data is automatically synced to the cloud.

### Social Login
We've integrated Google sign-in to our application using **Expo auth session**, and integration to **MongoDB Atlas** that have a seamless connection with the **Realm** local database making the login process easy and secure.

### Map Integration
Decided to use google maps api and for view still deciding.

## Future plans
 - [ ] Integration with other social sign-in methods (e.g., Facebook)
 - [ ] Improved route tracking and map display features
 - [ ] Enhanced offline data syncing functionality
